# Titanic-Kaggle-ML

This was a code I have used for my participation on Kaggle's "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview" >here</a>). 

I was able to achieve 76.5%. Still working on the project, going to add some parts.

I have used
- SVC
- Decision Tree
- KNN
- MLP
- GaussianNB
